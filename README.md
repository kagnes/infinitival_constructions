# Infinitival Constructions in Hungarian
## FinInf.txt

The list is created using the Hungarian Gigaword Corpus, version 2.0.4. It contains finite verbs (including particle verbs) which can take an infinitive as their argument. Only verbs occurring at least 5 times with an infinitive are preserved. As for particle verbs, they were counted only if they had immediately preverbal particle (written together with the verb).

Every finite verb can have its replica in infinitive form, e.g. *elmenni elment* 'as for going away, he/she has indeed gone away'. This type of infinitival constructions is not included in this list.

Verbs having a modal or a causative suffix are counted as separate types because they have different lemmata in HGC, e.g. *csinál* 'to do st', *csinálhat* 'to be able/allowed to do st' and *csináltat* 'to make sy do st'.

There are ambiguous cases where the POS-tagger could not choose between the possible lemmata. In this case, the variants are separated by a pipe.

In a lot of cases, a complex predicate should be present instead of the single finite verb. For example, *tekint INF* is mostly *kötelességének tekint INF* 'he/she considers it his/her duty to do something'. At the moment, we can not deal with these cases. Only the finite verbs appear in the list.

Frequent, wrong constructions are purged manually.
